        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

        <p>I think white space and clean design is important to Prior's site design. They use a lot of colorful, busy images, and if the rest of their site was colorful and busy it would be confusing to navigate, and it would take away the emphasis that the white space gives the images. It's important functionally and aesthetically! It helps draw the eye to important parts of the page.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <a href="https://koox.co.uk/home">koox.co.uk</a>

          alt="food"
        />
        <p>I think that Koox's website shows us a way to use visual heirchy. There are a lot of different elements on the home page (the plant/food illustrations, the titles, links...) If the designer had not made sure that these elements had visual heirchy, the page would be confusing. They create visual heirchy in the colors they use, the size they choose to make the objects, and the composition. They most important elements/information are big, dark in color, and in the center of the page. The background (which should grab your eye the least) is very light and the pattern has very little contrast. The plant/illustrative elements on the page have a medium value, are smaller than the important elements, but not too small, and they are composed in a way that leads your eye in a circle around the most important information. All this create a visual hierarchy that prioritizes elements by importance.</p>

        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

        <p>
          Franshals Museum used Hick's Law to help the user sort information so they don't have to waster their time, lose interest, or be confused. When looking through their exhibitions and events, they have helpful categories to choose from. These include what, when, who. They can choose what kind of info they are looking for. They can choose when the info they're looking for was/is/will be. They can choose who this information is for. This is a great example of Hick's Law. If they didn't utilize this law, there would be a lot of info to sort through seeing that they have a lot of info from year's past.
