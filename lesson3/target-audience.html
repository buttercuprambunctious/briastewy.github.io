<p>
  Target Audience
  <br />
  This site's target audience is for people who not only want to know the
  weather in their area, but also what the weather is for any friends/family
  they have in two other cities! They can also use this website when they visit
  their friends/family in the two other cities. If I could, I would make it so
  they can select whatever cities they want, but for the sake of the assignment
  it's targeted to people who live in either Ridgecrest, Salem, or Kennewick,
  and then have friends/family in two of these cities.

  Two personas
  <br />
  <br />
  Wichelle Shankshershanks <br />

  Wichelle lives in Salem, Utah. She likes to know the weather in the areas of
  where her kids live. She checks the weather of these areas regularly. She
  often uses the information she gathers to send an informative text to one of
  her children, for example: "It's rainy today, be careful while driving!" or
  "It's 120 degrees today! Wow!" or "There was an earthquake in your city! (not
  weather but she does it)" She might even send her daughter a kite if it's the
  been windy in her city.
  <br /><br />
  Beacheal BÃ¶k <br />

  Beacheal lives in Kennewick, Washington. He loves the outdoors and is very
  adventurous. It's important that he stays up to date with the weather in his
  area so he can plan accordingly, whether he's biking, hiking, driving, or
  chopping wood. He loves traveling and hitting up any national parks or places
  near his family, so he checks the weather of where they live when traveling.
